This class is intended for small ZIP files of only a few Kbytes (maybe upto a couple of Mb).
If bigger ZIP files are needed the other approach must be used.

These ZIP files are generated on Gem memory and depending on the Gem Temp Object Memory configuration a big ZIP can crash the Gem or make it unusable for some time.
